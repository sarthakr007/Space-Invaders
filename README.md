# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders is a shooter game in which the player fires at aliens overhead by moving a laser weapon across the bottom of the screen. As a group, the aliens travel left and right, shifting downward as they approach the screenâ€™s edge. The objective is to shoot all of the aliens to death. The game finishes quickly if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen while the player has three lives.
